# Introduction

Understanding the mechanisms of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is crucial in cybersecurity. This paper explores the lifecycle of a DDoS attack, from the initial infection of hosts to the denial of service for a website. 

## Summary

1. [The Sandbox](#the-sandbox) - Setting up the environment for testing and analysis.
2. [Host Compromise](#host-compromise) - Methods used to infect and control hosts.
3. [Launching the Attack](#launching-the-attack) - Execution of the DDoS attack.
4. [Demo](#demo) - Practical demonstration of a DDoS attack.
5. [Forensics](#forensics) - Investigating and understanding the aftermath of an attack.
6. [Conclusion and Mitigation](#conclusion-and-mitigation) - Summarizing findings and discussing mitigation strategies.
